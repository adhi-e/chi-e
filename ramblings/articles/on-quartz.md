# On Quartz

## TLDR;

I'm too ̶l̶a̶z̶y overworked to use Quartz.

## The Full Story

Welp. I am a merchant. I like tradition. As such, I feel the need to address Quartz. Don't get me wrong. Quartz is amazing. It's a useful tool for people to use to aesthetic-ise their pages. I just find it useless. And I can't be bothered using it myself. The sole reason for the town is to provide refuge for visitors from far away. To provide *information*. This reason is not to look all pretty and fancy. But sure, if you want to, dress up your pages. I won't stop you. If you find that Quartz works for you, use it. I simply cannot be bothered.
