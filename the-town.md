# The Town  
### After a lot of roaming around the desert, I find myself within the town.  
### It's a small town, but very lively.  

### It offers a nice break from the zephyrs (homework) winds (tests) and sandstorms (exams) of this giant desert (school).  

### I like it.  

### I was introduced to the town through [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/).  

### She's really nice and helped me set up my stall.  

### I'm quite new to the town and don't know many people, but I hear from [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/) that they are all really nice.  

### They all live within the town, and have very interesting houses.  

### *My Stall!*
