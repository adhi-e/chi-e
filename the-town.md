  <h1>The Town</h1>
  <p style:'text-align: center;'>After a lot of roaming around the desert, I find myself within the town. <br> It's a small town, but very lively. <br> It offers a nice break from the zephyrs (homework) winds (tests) and sandstorms (exams) of this giant desert (school).<br> I like it. <br> I was introduced to the town through <a href="https://harzavad.github.io/the-merchant/">Shan-Mei</a>. She's really nice and helped me set up my stall. <br> I'm quite new to the town and don't know many people, but I hear from Shan-Mei that they are all really nice. <br> They all live within the town, and have very interesting houses. <br> Maybe one day I can start living here too, but until then I'll be wandering around the desert.</p>
