# ATAR... Yay ðŸ™„

## 1.0 - Key Terms

### 1.1 - WACE

WACE - WA Certificate of Education  

### 1.2 - ATAR

ATAR - Australian Tertiary Admission Rank  
Ranges from 99.95 to 0  
Based on TEA (sum of best four scaled scores out of 400)  
For each subject:  
- 50% from school results/assessment
- 50% from WACE exams

SCALED BONUSES (yay)
> Imagine u do French, Math Methods, and Math Specialists. You would get 10% from French, 10% from Methods, and 10% from Spec adde to your TEA. Therefore, using this thing called 'Maths', your max ATAR would now be out of 430, not 400. Why? Bc it's like that now

ATAR is examined by SCSA.

## 2.0 - Requirements

To qualify for WACE, Year 11 students need to achieve a certain level of Literacy and Numeracy standards.  
- Band 8 or higher in NAPLAN  
- OLNA (if u fail NAPLAN which, honestly, how?)

## 3.0 - Subject Selections

Students are to choose their subjects for Years 10, 11, and 12. Requirements include:
- 2 Year 12 ATAR subjects from List A (arts, languages, hass)
- 2 Year 12 ATAR subjects from List... you guessed it, B. (maths, sciences, tech)

Do not change subjects between years 11 and 12. That's just stoopid.

You cannot do certain combinations of ATAR courses. Why? Because yes.  
- Math Apps + Math Spec
- Math Apps + Spec + Methods
- Spec by itself
- English + Lit

## 4.0 - SCALING (so much funnnn)

Apparently makes things 'fair' for every student.  

Varies year by year because SCSA likes making no sense.

Typically (*typically*) Physics, Chem, Spec, English, Lit, and Languages are scaled up.
