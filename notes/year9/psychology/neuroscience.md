# Neuroscience: What is it?

	- Examines the structure and function of the human brain and nervous system
	
##### [Interactive Brain](www.brainline.org/tbi-basics/interactive-brain)
	
Buried beneath the core of the brain:
	- Thalamus - relay station
		○ Receives signals going to and the cerebrum + other parts of the NS
		○ Integral part of the NS of sensory processing
		○ Involved in movement, emotion, memory, etc.
		○ 2, one on either side
	- Hypothalamus - pea-sized + below the thalamus
		○ Bodily regulation
			§ Body temp
			§ Sleep/wakefulness
			§ Hunger
			§ Release of stress hormone cortisol + other hormones
				□ E.g. Oxytocin, dopamine, vasopressin etc.
		○ Directly connected to + influences the functioning of the pituitary gland
			§ Pituitary gland releases various hormones into bloodstream
	- Amygdala - almond-shaped structure
		○ Produces emotional responses
		○ Integrate emotional aspects of experience into memory
		○ Produce fear-based memories and learning
		○ 2 of these in the brain
			§ Along with the hippocampus, 2 major parts of the limbic system
	- Hippocampus - resembles seahorse shape
		○ Central to the creation + filing away of memories
		○ Spatial processing - finding your way around
		○ 2 of these in the brain
			§ Along with the amygdalae, major parts of the limbic system
	- Basal ganglia - cluster of neurons
		○ Coordinated physical movements + habitual behaviours
