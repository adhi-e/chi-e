# Phrenology and Phineas Gage

**_Different parts of the brain control specific parts of our behvaiour_**

**_How do our brain functions control aspects of our lives?_**

### Phineas Gage

Phineas Gage, (born July 1823, New Hampshire, U.S.â€”died May 1860, California), American railroad foreman known for having survived a traumatic brain injury caused by an iron rod that shot through his skull and obliterated the greater part of the left frontal lobe of his brain.  
This accident changed Phineas' personality from well-mannered to vulgar. 
The incident proved that brain function is localized.  

Basically,  
God: _U must die_  
Phineas: _How about no_
