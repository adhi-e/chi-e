# HOW TO WRITE AN ESSAY 101

## Structure

*Write a structure to ensure that the essay has multiple points, rather than just one really good idea. This also helps when you get mind blanks.*  

A structure can be anything, really. In practice, in an examination, the structure would probably look something like this.  

Thesis: technology interacts with teenagers in multiple ways, creating societal issues and structures that haven't previously been operational.  
P1 – gender – s.o.d.  
P2 – tech underfunded – interviews/stats  
P3 – teen identity – p.o.v./metaphors  
P4 – ethics - anecdote  

## Introduction

#### 1. General statement - Hook
  - Use hooks, quotes
  - If you don't have a hook, just a general philosophical thought or question will suffice

#### 2. Aim - rephrase the question
  - Note that in some Lit exams, you don't get a question and instead have to write your own. This mainly has to do with older years (year 10-12)

#### 3. Significance
  - Why is this question important?
  - Is it interesting?

#### 4. Thesis Statment
  - This is the argument and evidence proposed
  - How will you answer the question?

#### 5. Structure
  - Signposting
  - In analytical essays (essays which analyse a text), Structure and Theses are often done simultaneously
    - E.g. → Question on Characters: Identify the three characters you’re going to talk about, which is ur thesis and write a paragraph on each, which is ur structure

## Body of the Essay

#### Topic Sentence - 1 sentence
#### Examples and Techniques - 2 to 3 sentences
- Play techniques
  - Screen directions
  - Asides
  - Soliloquies
#### Contextualisation - 3 to 4 sentences
- Write about one of the following three aspects
  - Reader response
  - Context
   - Mainly historical
  - Author intent

*Remember to use the correct ratio of sentences. The topic sentence should be 1 sentence, the Example and Technique section should be 2 to 3 sentences, and the contextualisation section should be 3 to 4 sentences long.*  

## Conclusion

#### Consistency
The conclusion should be consistent with the rest of the material.

#### Summarise only
Do not introduce any new materials. This leads to an instant 10% deduction in WACE.  
I don't care if you get a really good idea while writing the conclusion. If that happens, If this happens, skip a few lines, put an asterix and then BP_ (body paragraph number _ ) and then continue from there.  
The final sentence needs to be very very strong and punchy. No *and that's why i'm right* or *therefore we can see that ______ is proven*.
