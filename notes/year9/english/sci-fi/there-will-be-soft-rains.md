# There Will Be Soft Rains by Ray Bradbury, 1950

## Excerpt (Introduction of TWBSR)

In the living room the voice-clock sang, Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up, seven o 'clock! as if it were afraid that nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clock ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. Seven-nine, breakfast time, seven-nine! In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunny side up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.  

"Today is August 4, 2026," said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, "in the city of Allendale, California." It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. "Today is Mr. Featherstone's birthday. Today is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. Insurance is payable, as are the water, gas, and light bills." Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes. Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school, off to work, run, run, eight-one! But no doors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weather box on the front door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; umbrellas, raincoats for today..." And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing. Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the door swung down again.  

At eight-thirty the eggs were shrivelled and the toast was like stone. An aluminium wedge scraped them into the sink, where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry.  

## Questions

1. Setting
2. Sci-fi Technology
3. What is happening? What plot points are being established?

### 1. Setting
The excerpt describes a kitchen that is seemingly unoccupied yet continues on as if it were.  
City of Allendale, California, in August 4, 2026. Describes the city as very robotic, almost utopian (in terms of human labour) but not very happy (implying dystopia). Gives off very Post Apocalyptic Vibes. Possibility of it being a horror story (there is a clear case of disjointment).  

### 2. Sci-fi Technology
Describes a drain as __a metal throat__, as well as other machines like dishwashers with terms like __hot washer__. This implies some world where terms for these items do not exist, possibly due to intervention from higher authorities.  
The entire house can be described as an 'insane smart house', like a very advanced Google Home. The house has a calendar system, which makes sure everything runs smoothly. Additionally, the phrase __Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes.__ somewhat accurately predicts future technology (as in, there is this understanding of using technology that is quite outdated, but the general functions are similar to the modern day). There's also an idea of an __aluminum wedge__ which metaphorically embodies the digestive system with words such as __digested and flushed__ further adding to this effect. 

### 3. What is happening? What plot points are being established? (think about tone)
The house is still acting as though people are inhabiting it, despite this being false. The house itself can be described as 'depressed' in a sense that it is very robotic and lifeless. There is clear tension in the story.
