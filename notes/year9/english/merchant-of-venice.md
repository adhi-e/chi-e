## 2.0 - Context

#### 2.1 - Christian-dominant society
The Elizabethan era was a Christian dominant society. This began with the Jewish Diaspora around 200 years earlier. They believe that Jesus was killed by the Jewish people because the Bible depicts it. Thus, the Christians made it there mission to convert all Jewish people to Christianity, and commonly mistreated and discriminated against Jewish people.

##### 2.1.1 - Usury
The Jews often charged interest when lending money. As depicted in the Bible, Jewish people were charging interest when lending money. This was allowed in the Old Testament. However, some felt this was predatory behaviour and unethical. Especially given where it was occurring, in the Temple courts - a sacred space. Jesus drove out the Jewish moneylenders and overturned their tables, and forbade people from profiting from moneylending. Consequently, Christians were legally unable to charge interest, whereas the Jews were. This led to Christians believing that the Jewish people were all selfish and greedy.  

#### 2.2 - Women in Shakespeare's society
In the Elizabethan era there were laws preventing women from owning property, attending school/university, and voting. In fact, having a queen as the leader of England was quite controversial, so much so that before the Spanish Armada, Queen Elizabeth is quoted as saying *"I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king."*. Within the play, we see Portia, who challenges the traditional partiarchal views by having some power over her future and being well educated. This was unusual for the time.

## 3.0 - Themes

#### 3.1 - Prejudice, racism, and 'the other'
The anti-semitism mentioned earlier in Section 2.1 and 2.1.1 is demonstrated through the representation of Shylock versus the other characters.  
Shylock's character is represented as a greedy moneylender who wants to hurt Antonio. He is represented as a person who is different from the rest of society. On the other hand, Antonio is a Christian lending money without interest. Despite his kind appearance, he constantly berates and ridicules Shylock.  

##### 3.1.1 - Foreshadowing Shylock's conversion to Christianity, pun and motif
> "Hie thee, gentle Jew. The Hebrew will turn Christian. He grows kind." - Antonio (Act 1, Scene 3)  
> "We all expect a gentle answer, Jew." - Antonia (Act 4, Scene 1)  

Gentle means someone who is kind and good-hearted. The word *gentile* also means *not Jewish*. The play on words forshadows Shylock's conversion to Christianity. Additionally, the term *gentle* becomes a motif as Antonio uses it to mock Shylock.  

##### 3.1.2 - Motif of 'devil' used to describe Shylock
> "Let me say *Amen* betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew" - Solanio (Act 3, Scene 1)
> "Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation" - Lancelot (Act 2, Scene 2)

Throughout the play, Shylock is referred to as the devil. This highlights how the Christians attempt to draw parallels between Jewish people and the devil.

##### 3.1.3 - Repetition in Shylock's monologue (Act 3, Scene 1)
> "I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes. Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, sense, affections... Hurt with the same weapons... Healed by the same means... Cooled by the same winter and summer... If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" - Shylock

Shylock laments about how the Venetians mistreat him due to his Jewish faith. He draws on human features and experiences to highlight how they are all the same. Shakespeare aims to create sympathy to the discriminated peoples of society.
