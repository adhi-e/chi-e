#### 3.2.3 - Revenge and Vengeance

The idea that revenge and vengeance is an innate human trait. Evidenced in Shylock's monoluge in Act 3.

### 3.3 - Practice Paragraph

In Shakespeare's *The Merchant of Venice*, themes of vengeance, revenge, and holding grudges are present. The text represents revenge as an innate human trait. Revenge in this context refers to the desire to inflict damage on someone or something that has wronged you in the past. This notion is shown through Shylock's monologue in Act 2, best illustrated when he says his famous monologue,  
> *"If you prick us, do we not bleed?  
> If you tickle us, do we not laugh?  
> If you poison us, do we not die?  
> And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"*

>> Act 3, Scene 1, Lines 57 to 59

The parallels drawn by Shakespeare in these lines showcase the natural reflexes of humanity, and Shylock includes the final line, *"If you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"* to justify his actions. This excerpt positions the audience to agree wih Shylock and feel sympathy towards him. This clearly demonstrates the effortless way Shakespeare represents the idea of revenge as being innately human.
