# 9.1 Overview of Myanmar
> *Myanmar (sometimes referred to as Burma) is a Southeast Asian country that has attracted widespread international attention in recent years. For a long time, it was an isolated pariah on the international stage before being applauded for its transition to democracy under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi. In more recent years, Myanmar has been in the international spotlight for its treatment of the Rohingya Minority group.*
