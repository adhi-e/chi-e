## 9.3.1 The Rohingya People in Myanmar

[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/rohingya-crisis)  

__The United Nations has said that the Burmese military forces have showed “genocidal intent,” towards the Rohingya people. What does the term 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' mean?__ Genocide is described as the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group. Ethnic cleansing is described as the mass expulsion or killing of members of one ethnic or religious group in an area by those of another.  

__How many Rohingya people are there in the world? How many of these live in Myanmar?__ There are around three and a half million Rohingya peoples in the world. Of this figure, nearly one million live in Myanmar, specifically the Rakhine State.  

__What is the legal status of the Rohingya people in Myanmar? Are they legal citizens? Why are they treated this way?__ The Rohingya People are refused citizenship by the Burmese government. The Rohingya have been able to register as temporary residents with identification cards, known as white cards, which the military began issuing to Islamic groups, both Rohingya and non-Rohingya. Even in the 'free and fair' elections in 2015, no parliamentary candidate was of the Muslim faith. They have been constantly discriminated by the Islamophobic and predominantly Buddhist government and military junta.  

__Why are the Rohingya people fleeing Myanmar and where are they migrating to?__ The Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar due to the discrimination and restrictions they face. Examples of these restrictions include having photographs of headscarf-less brides in order to marry, which conflict with Islamic beliefs. The Rohingya are migrating mainly to Bangladesh and Malaysia, however some small amounts also dispersed to India, Thailand, and Indonesia.

__What has the Burmese Government said about accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide?__ The government has rejected the accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Myanmar has stated that they will never espouse policy of genocide or ethnic cleansing and that the government will do everything to prevent it.
