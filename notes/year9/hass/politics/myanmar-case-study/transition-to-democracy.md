# 9.2 Myanmar's Transition to Democracy

## 1. Myanmar's Transition to Democracy

Why were the 2012 Burmese By-elections significant in the history of Myanmar?  
> Whilst the total number of seats (45) was not enough to change the balance of power, it was a huge step forward from being completely under a military dictatorship. Burmese voters U Aung Sangh and Daw Seh Mawe said that this election would lead to more freedom, a better economy, and higher rates of education, which are all important factors.  

Why are people in Myanmar reluctant to speak out against the Military?  
> Many people are not sure what to think about the Military suddenly allowing elections, as they had been unable to speak openly without fear of retribution. Any criticism of the regime led to prison sentences.  

In what ways was the 2012 Election limited in achieving true democracy?  
> As mentioned before, the election is for 45 seats, which is not enough to change the balance of power. As such, the government would still be very military based.  

Who is seen as the symbol of hope for Myanmar?  
> Her Excellency Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is seen as the symbol of hope for Myanmar, and her NLD party won 43 of the total 45 seats. She won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.  

Why did Myanmar Transition to Democracy?  
> Myanmar's transition to democracy was sparked by the sanctions placed upon the country by the European Union whilst it was under the military dictatorship, and also due to internal protests.
