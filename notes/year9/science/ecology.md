## Objectives

### Ecosystems

#### Objective 1: I can define ecosystem, biotic and abiotic factors.

__Ecosystem:__ a collection of living things which interact with each other and with their environment.  
__Biotic Factors:__ living things in an ecosystem. *bio-* means life. examples include animals, plants, and bacteria.  
__Abiotic Factors:__ non-living things in an ecosystem. *a-* means not, *bio-* means life. examples include air, water, temperature, etc.  

#### Objective 2: I can list the major biotic and abiotic factors.

| Biotic Factors | Abiotic Factors |
| --- | --- |
| Animals | Air |
| Plants | Water |
| Bacteria | Temperature |

#### Objective 3: I can measure and compare the abiotic factors in a range of natural spaces.



#### Objective 4: I can plan, conduct, process, and evaluate an investigation of the effect of an abiotic factor on germination of seeds. (CAT)



#### Objective 5: I can describe and give an example of each of the following relationships between organisms in an ecosystem: competition, collaboration, predator prey, disease.

__Competition:__ interaction between organisms in which both require a resource that is in limited supply. for instance, plants in a garden may compete with each other for soil nutrients, water, and light.  
__Collaboration:__ interaction between organisms in which both parties work together to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.  
__Predator:__ an organism that eats prey. examples inclue lions, tigers, cheetahs, et cetera.  
__Prey:__ an organism that is eaten by the predator. examples include rabbits, small birds, et cetera.  
__Disease:__ a functional disorder in a human, animal, or plant, that has a known cause and a distinct group of symptoms, signs, or other changes.  

#### Objective 6: I can define symbiotic relationships.

__Symbiotic Relationships:__ a close, prolonged association between two or more different biological species. this relationship can be mutualistic, parasitic, or commensalistic.

#### Objective 7: I can describe and give an example of the following symbiotic relationships: parasitism, mutualism, commensalism.

__Parasitism:__ a relationship between two living species where one organism is benefitted at the expense of the other.  
__Mutualism:__ a relationship in which both species are mutually benefitted. both species are referred to as symbionts.  
__Commensalism:__ a relationship where one organism benefits off another organism, yet not the other way around.  

#### Objective 8: I can identify the original source of all energy as the sun.



#### Objective 9: I can describe the role of photosynthesis as the process producers use to transform the sun's energy into chemical energy.



#### Objective 10: I can describe the role of cellular respiration as the process consumers use to extract energy from organic matter.



#### Objective 11: I can construct food chains to demonstrate the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next.



#### Objective 12: I can summarise the roles of primary consumers, secondary consumers, top consumers, omnivores, scavengers, detritivores, and decomposeres, and give an example of each.
