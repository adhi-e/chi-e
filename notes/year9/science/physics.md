## Waves and Energy Motion
- wave motion is a transfer of energy
  - wave motion has no net movement of matter
  - it does, however, transfer energy
- different forms of energy, such as heat, light, and sound, are transferred in waves, which come in two types
  - transverse waves ⇒ :wavy_dash:
   - direction of energy movement is perpendicular to the displacement of particles
   - move :arrow_double_up: and :arrow_double_down:
  - longitudinal waves ⇒ || | |  |  |  | | || | |  |  |  | | ||
   - direction of energy movement is parallel to the displacement of particles
   - move :arrow_backward: and :arrow_forward:
  - there are two other types of waves, mechanical and electromagnetic
   - in electromagnetic waves, energy is transferred through vibrations of electric and magnetic fields
    - it doesnt need a medium to transfer energy
   - mechanical waves need a medium to transfer its energy through
    - energy transferred through vibrations
    - gradually lose energy
    - heat transfers through vibrations
    - electricity can be transferred through a medium/vacuum
    - light can be transferred through a medium/vacuum
    - sound waves need a medium to travel through
     - denser :arrow_right: faster
