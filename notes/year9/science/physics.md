# Physics

## Waves and Energy Motion
- wave motion is a transfer of energy
  - wave motion has no net movement of matter
  - it does, however, transfer energy
- different forms of energy, such as heat, light, and sound, are transferred in waves, which come in two types
  - transverse waves ⇒ 〰
   - direction of energy movement is perpendicular to the displacement of particles
   - move :arrow_double_up: and :arrow_double_down:
  - longitudinal waves ⇒ || | |  |  |  | | || | |  |  |  | | ||
   - direction of energy movement is parallel to the displacement of particles
   - move ◀ and ▶
  - there are two other types of waves, mechanical and electromagnetic
   - in electromagnetic waves, energy is transferred through vibrations of electric and magnetic fields
    - it doesnt need a medium to transfer energy
   - mechanical waves need a medium to transfer its energy through
    - energy transferred through vibrations
    - gradually lose energy
    - heat transfers through vibrations
    - electricity can be transferred through a medium/vacuum
    - light can be transferred through a medium/vacuum
    - sound waves need a medium to travel through
     - denser ➡ faster
- Radios, TVs, Phones
  - Use waves to communicate
- Speed ➡ how fast a wave travels
- Wavelength ➡ distance between each crest, represented by λ (lambda)
- Frequency ➡ wavelengths per second (λ/s)
- Period ➡ time taken for 1 wavelength (not frequency)
- Amplitude ➡ height from middle of the wave to the crest
- Formulae
  - Velocity (Speed) = Frequency x λ (Wavelength)
  - Time / Period = 1 / Frequency
  - Distance = Speed x Time

## Wave Behaviour and the Electromagnetic Spectrum
- Electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave meaning it does not need a medium to transfer energy through
- In electromagnetic waves, energy is transferred through electrical and magnetic fields
- The speed of light is around $3 * 10^8$
