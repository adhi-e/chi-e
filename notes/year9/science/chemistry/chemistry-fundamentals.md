## Coulomb's Law and Atomic Applications

Coulomb's Law states that *like charges repel and unlike charges attract*  

In atoms, protons have a +1 charge, electrons have a -1 charge, and neutrons have no charge.  

Hence, neutrons are used in the nucleus to 'glue' electrons together, and electrons in an atom repel and are therefore evenly spread out.  

In electron shells, protons keep electrons in their respective shells, and electrons keep the distinct shells apart.  

## Calculating Ions

Take for example, Beryllium. Beryllium has 4 protons, 5 neutrons, and 4 electrons. To make full shells, Beryllium either needs to lose 2 electrons (To make 1 full shell) *or* gain 6 electrons (To make 2 full shells). Realistically, it's easier to lose 2 electrons than gain 6 electrons, thereby gaining a charge of +2 (charge is calculated through protons + electrons, so in this case, 4 + -2 or +2)  

A special example: Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons. To make full shells, Carbon needs to either lose 4 electrons (to make 1 complete shell) or gain 4 electrons (to make 2 complete shells). However, we see that in the end, neither happens, and Carbon stays with an incomplete shell.
