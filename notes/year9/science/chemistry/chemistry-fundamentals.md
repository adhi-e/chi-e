## Coulomb's Law and Atomic Applications

Coulomb's Law states that *like charges repel and unlike charges attract*  

In atoms, protons have a +1 charge, electrons have a -1 charge, and neutrons have no charge.  

Hence, neutrons are used in the nucleus to 'glue' electrons together, and electrons in an atom repel and are therefore evenly spread out.  

In electron shells, protons keep electrons in their respective shells, and electrons keep the distinct shells apart.
