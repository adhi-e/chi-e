# Naming Compounds

## Bonding

When trying to get full valence shells, we need to consider what types of elements we are dealing with in how it bonds and how we name the compound.

Metal X Metal

- Tends to form an alloy and the electrons are shared between a metallic lattice.

- Pure metals are given their element names. We do not go into the naming of alloys.

## Ionic Bonding

Metals lose electrons to non-metals. The metal loses an electron (becoming a cation) and the non-metal gains an electron (becoming an ̶o̶n̶i̶o̶n anion).

As such, the two atoms have opposite charges, forming an ionic bond.
