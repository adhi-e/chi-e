# Chemistry Terminology

## Subatomic Particles

Subatomic particles are the building blocks of atoms. There are three parts: Neutrons, Protons, and Electrons.

Neutrons have a charge of 0, and have a mass of 1 amu.

Protons have a charge of +1, and have a mass of 1 amu.

Electrons have a charge of -1, and have a mass of 0.000549 amu, also notated as 1/1840 amu.

AMU stands for Atomic Mass Unit.

## Reading The Periodic Table

![Oxygen](https://github.com/harzavad/the-merchant/assets/133340321/94ecf9d6-8285-4649-9127-48a038e18d02)

Take for example the above tile. The above number is atomic number. This is the number of protons. Next, the larger letter (or letters) is the elemental symbol. Then, underneath this, we have the element name. Finally, underneath this, we have the atomic mass.

Note that the atomic masses are generally not whole numbers, because of isotopes.

The number of protons in an atom is its atomic number.

The number of neutrons in an atom is the atomic number subtracted from the atomic mass.

The number of electrons in a neutral atom (no overall net charge) is also the atomic number.

## Terminology

__ELEMENT:__

- Contain a specific number of protons
- All carbon atoms have 6 protons, all atoms with 103 protons are lawrencium, etc.

__Isotope:__

- Contain a specific number of neutrons
- Hydrogen-1 has 0 neutrons and 1 proton, Hydrogen-2 has 1 neutron and 1 proton, etc.

__Ion:__

- Any atom where the number of protons is not equal to the number of electrons
- Remember when notating, the charge is written as #+ or #-, not +# or -#. I.e., 3+ is the correct order.
- To calculate this charge, we determine how many more electrons are needed for a full shell.

__Compound:__

- 2 or more *different* elements combined
- NaCl, H20, etc.
- NOT O2, because there is only one element in total

__Molecule:__

- Specific number of non-metal atoms bonded together in a specific ratio
- Ethanoic Acid
  - Molecular Formula ⇒ C2H4O2
    - Molecular Formula is useful to know how many of each element there is.
  - Structural Formula ⇒ CH3COOH
    - Structural Formula is useful to know how the elements are related.

## Bonding

All bonding occurs due to Coulombs law and the attraction between protons and electrons.

__Covalent Bonding:__ A type of bonding that occurs between non-metals where they 'share' electrons in order to complete their valence shells.

__Ionic Bonding:__ A type of bonding that occurs between metals and non-metals where they form ions and then their overall difference in charge attracts them to one another.
