    <h2><em>The Effect of Solute Concentration on Osmosis in Potato Cells</em></h2>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <def><abbr>Concentration</abbr> The amount of a substance in a certain volume of a solution.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Solute</abbr> The substance that is dissolved.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Solvent</abbr> The substance in which the solute dissolves.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Solution</abbr> A homogenous mixture of two or more substances.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Homogenous Mixture</abbr> A mixture where the substances are evenly distributed throughout the solvent.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Concentration Gradient</abbr> A difference in the concentration of a substance from one location to another.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Diffusion</abbr> The movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Semi-Permeable Membrane</abbr> A membrane that allows certain things to pass through.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>ATP</abbr> Adenosine Triphosphate - Energy - is required for Active Transport.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Osmosis</abbr> A type of diffusion that involves the diffusion of water from hypotonic solutions to hypertonic solutions across a semi-permeable membrane.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr> Vesicle Transport</abbr> Molecules or particles are too large to pass through plasma membrane, and instead move throughout a transport protein.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Endocytosis</abbr> The process of capturing a substance or particle from outside cells by engulfing it with the cell membrane. The two types of Endocytosis are Phagocytosis and Pinocytosis</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Phagocytosis</abbr> Phagocytosis occurs when dissolved materials enter a cell and the plasma membrane engulfs solid material, forming a phagocytic vesicle.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Pinocytosis</abbr> Pinocytosis is when a plasma membrane folds inwards to form a channel allowing dissolved substances to enter a cell. When the channel is closed, liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.</abbr>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Exocytosis</abbr> Exocytosis describes the process of a vesicle fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing contents on outside of a cell. It occurs when a cell produces substance for export (protein) or when a cell is getting rid of waste products or toxins. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the plasma membrane by exocytosis.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Active Transport</abbr> The movement of particles through cell membrane from region of lower concentration to higher concentration. It requires energy from respiration and therefore cannot occur in dead cells.</def>
    <br>
    <def><abbr>Passive Transport</abbr> Type of transport which doesn't require energy. It is the movement of a solute from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration. Examples include Diffusion and Osmosis.</def>
    <br>
    <h2><em>Other Information</em></h2>
    <p>What factors affect the rate of diffusion?</p>
    <p><abbr>Concentration Gradient. </abbr>There is a greater difference in concentration on either side of membrane, faster movement across will occur. The higher the concentration - the more random collisions against the membrane.</p>
    <p><abbr>Mass of Molecules. </abbr>Heavier molecules - slower movement.</p>
    <p><abbr>Temperature. </abbr>Increase in temperature > Increase in energy > Increased rate of diffusion.</p>
    <p><abbr>Surface area and thickness of the membrane. </abbr>Larger membrane leads to faster rate of diffusion. Increased thickness leads to decreased rate of diffusion.</p>
    <p><abbr>Distance. </abbr>Smaller distance molecules need to travel, the faster the transport. Blood capillaries and alveoli have walls which are 1 cell thick which ensure the rate of diffusion across is as fast as possible.</p>
