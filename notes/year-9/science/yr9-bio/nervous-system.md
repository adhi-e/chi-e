## Central Nervous System  
- Consists of the Brain and the Spinal Chord
- Receives information from the <abbr title="Peripheral Nervous System">PNS</abbr>

## Peripheral Nervous System  
- Sends information to <abbr title="Central Nervous System">CNS</abbr>
- Sensory (afferent) ⇒ Collects and carries info to the <abbr title="Central Nervous System">CNS</abbr>
- Motor (efferent) ⇒ Instructions from the <abbr title="Central Nervous System">CNS</abbr>
  - Autonomic ⇒ Involuntary
   - Self-regulating
    - Requires the brain
   - Regulates involuntary smooth muscles that control activity of organs
   - Examples
    - Breathing
    - Heart Rate
    - Activity levels
    - Heart
    - Pupils
    - Bladder
  - Somatic ⇒ Voluntary
   - Transmits commands to muscles voluntarily
   - Motor neurons connect to skeletal muscles

## Sympathetic/Parasympathetic
- Sympathetic
  - 'fight or flight'
  - mobilizes body systems during emergencies
  - triggers cascade of hormones in endocrine system
- Parasympathetic
  - 'rest and digest'
  - conserves energy
  - promotes nonenergy functions
  - triggered by mindfullness activities

## Synapse
- area around where neurons meet
- activates synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters that can pass through the synaptic cleft
