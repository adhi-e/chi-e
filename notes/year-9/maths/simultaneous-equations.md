    <h2>Solving Simultaneous Equations<h2>
    <p><i><b>ACMNA237</b> — Solve linear simultaneous equations using algebraic and graphical techniques including digital technology.</i></p>
    <h3>The Substitution Method</h3>
    <p>When solving equations simultaneously, we are looking for some values for our variables which make both equations true. This means that in two equations in terms of <span class="math_equation">x</span> and <span class="math_equation">y</span>, each variable can be considered to be some fixed value for both equations- even if we don't know what that value is yet.</p>
    <p>By assuming that the values for <span class="math_equation">x</span> and <span class="math_equation">y</span> in one equation are the same as for the other equation, we are able to substitute the value of a variable from one equation into the other.</p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>To solve simultaneous equations using substitution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Substitute the expression for one variable, usually <span class="math_equation">y</span>, into the other equation.</li>
        <li>Solve the new equation for the other variable, usually <span class="math_equation">x</span>.</li>
        <li>Substitute the result back into one of the equations to find the value of the other variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Elimination Method</h3>
    <p>In order to solve two equations with multiple variables simultaneously, we need a way to combine the information in both equations into a single equation with only one variable.</p>
    <p>The  substitution method  achieves this by setting the values of the variables to be equal across both equations and then substituting the value of one variable into the other.</p>
    <p>Another way to achieve this is using the elimination method, which takes a combination of the two equations such that all but one variable is eliminated.</p>
    <p>Combining equations relies on the fact that the left and right-hand sides of any given equation are equal. Because they are equal, we can make expressions out of the two equations that still hold true.</p>
    <p>For example, if we know that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Equation 1: <span class="math_equation">a = b</span></li>
        <li>Equation 1: <span class="math_equation">c = d</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We made these two new equations by adding or subtracting one equation from the other. We can also take multiples of equations before combining them. As such, these equations must also hold true.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a</li>
    </ul>
